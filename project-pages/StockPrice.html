        <div class="body-text">This project explores how various machine learning models can predict stock prices and how a financial dashboard can help novice investors understand stock data. The study evaluates five machine learning models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). These models are assessed using metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the R-Square Score (R²). The Linear Regression model performed the best, achieving an RMSE of 4.6719 and an R² score of 0.8643. The project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in stock prediction and provides a user-friendly financial dashboard for better data comprehension.</div>

          <div class="body-text">For my stock price prediction project, I retrieved six years of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock data using the yfinance package, with the first five years for training and evaluation, and the last year for testing. Preprocessing involved selecting adjusted stock prices, creating datasets with parameters for lagged periods and forecast periods, splitting data by year, and normalizing it with MinMaxScaler. I trained and evaluated Linear Regression, optimized Ridge Regression with grid search, and neural networks (RNN, LSTM, and GRU), iteratively improving their architecture. Models were assessed using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R² Score.</div>
          <div class="body-text"> Additionally, I used Streamlit to create a dynamic dashboard, enabling users to select stocks and industries for analysis and prediction through various charts, including violin plots and line graphs. Key skills demonstrated in this project include data collection and preprocessing, machine learning model development and optimization, and interactive data visualization.</div>
